    <p class="about">Hear me out, Toxic Individuals' Victims. I'm communicating directly to you, my fellow Toxic Freaks, through the power of programming and networking. My sole objective is to offer a forum that is unrelated to the University and is not professional. The Big Capo's ambition to eradicate the entire philosophy is currently present, and it won't stop with our page. They won't be satisfied until each and every one of you freaks is exposed for spamming. They won't be able to do as they like. You are all of our hope, so act like a nice guy and keep your cool.</p>
